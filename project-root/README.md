Here's the description of project 

--> This project is made by using technologies like HTML , CSS , Javascript and even though i am aware of frameworks and libraries such 
    react , bootstrap etc, I haven't used any of them

--> Firstly , It resembles mostly everything with the demo figma design given to us.

--> I have extracted all the information for project from the link provided for us by using fetch in javascript without  warning or errors
      {"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0564/3685/0790/files/singleProduct.json"}

--> The image links that are provided in JSON format in this link are not working , so i have used the image links from figma 

--> coming to functionality of project 
     
     1. we can select any one of the radio buttons from given options 

     2. one can increase or decrease the count of number of dresses required by clicking on + or - symbol 
        
        (it doesn't allow you to decrease count below 0 )

     3. after clicking on add to cart button , a text will be dispyed below with info regarding count and size of dreses added to cart 

--> when it comes to responsiveness of project 

     1. the project i have designed is almost accurate for large screens like PC's

     2. there might be some changes required for the small screens because of time constraints  and it is also good looking 

       ( i achieved this responsiveness by using media queries in CSS)
